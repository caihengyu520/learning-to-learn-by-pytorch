Learning to learn by gradient descent by gradient descent

A simple re-implementation by PyTorch

- For Quadratic experiments


The project can be run in the whole [project](project/) or a [python file](learning_to_learn.py)

```
python learning_to_learn.py
```
or

```
python project/main.py 
```

This code is designed for a better understanding and easy implementation of `learning to learn`
